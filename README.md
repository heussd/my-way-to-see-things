# my-way-to-see-things

This repository contains a fine-tuned CSS style that I personally like to use to view things. "Things" primarily include Markdown documents in [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/) and RSS news in [Vienna](http://www.vienna-rss.org).


The style is optimised for Retina displays, and furthermore implements my personal preferences for fonts sizes, families, colours and layout. See [text-sample.html](text-sample.html).

`installstyles.command` installs the style in the mentioned programs [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/) and [Vienna](http://www.vienna-rss.org).
